EXERCISE 3.10 
if ((varA && varB) || (!varA && !varB))
    
EXERCISE 3.11
varA != varB
    
EXERCISE 3.12
varA == varB

EXERCISE 3.15
The modulo operator calculates an interger division and returns only the remainder of the division.

EXERCISE 3.16
(8 % 3) = 2


EXERCISE 3.20
The increment method adds one to the interger value, and then returns the remainder of the intergers value, and limit using a modulo operator.
The variable value is then re-initialized with that remainder.

EXERCISE 3.21
The modulo operator solution is better because it uses less space in system memory than the if statement solution. It also is visibly easier to follow.

EXERCISE 3.24
Call the timeTick method 60 times.
Call the setTime method and enter 1 as the hour value, and 00 as the minute value.
